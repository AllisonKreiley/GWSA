# GWSA
Custom code and widgets for The Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA), signed in August of 2008, created a framework for reducing heat-trapping emissions to levels that scientists believe give us a reasonable chance of avoiding the worst effects of global warming. It requires reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from each sector of the economy summing to a total reduction of 25% below the 1990 baseline emission level in 2020 and at least an 80% reduction in 2050. This dashboard offers insights into the Commonwealthâ€™s progress towards the goals of the GWSA.
